## Introduction

This library provides you with a generic mechanism of attaching "jobs" to your React Components, and includes support for server rendering (i.e. within SSR/universal/isomorphic apps).

You can use these "jobs" to do any of the following:
 - Resolve additional data for your components in a sync/async manner.
 - Handle data preloading on the server.
 - Rehydrate a server data load on the client.
 - ... more?

It provides you with a simple `function` and `Promise` based API which allows you to easily compose additional features such as data caching or 3rd party integrations (e.g. Redux).

## Installation

__npm__

```bash
npm i react-jobs -S
```

__yarn__

```bash
yarn add react-jobs
```

## Usage

Below we will detail how to use this library for the typical _browser_-only use.

In the naive example below we will use the `fetch` API (you'll need to [polyfill it](https://github.com/github/fetch) for older browsers) to retrieve data from an API endpoint.

```js
import React from 'react';
import { job } from 'react-jobs'; // üëç
import Product from './components/Product';

function Products(props) {
  const {
    job, // üëà we provide you this prop representing the state of the "job"
    categoryID,
  } = props;

  if (job.inProgress) {
    // If the work is still being processed (i.e. the Promise
    // is not yet resolved) then the `job.inProgress` boolean flag
    // value will be set to `true`.
    return <div>Retrieving...</div>;
  }

  if (job.error) {
    // If an error occurred whilst trying to execute your work
    // then the `job.error` will contain the error.
    return <div>Oh noes!</div>;
  }

  // Yay! We have the results!
  return (
    <div>
      {
        job.results.map(product =>
          <Product key={product.id} item={product} />
        )}
    </div>
  );
}

// You use the job function to attach work to your component.
//             üëá
export default job(
  // Provide a function defining the work that needs to be done.
  // This function will be provided the props passed to your
  // component and must return a Promise for any asynchronous work.
  function work(props) {
    // Fetch the products for the given `categoryID` prop,
    return fetch(`/products/category/${props.categoryID}`)
      // then convert the response to JSON.
      .then(response => response.json());
  }
)(Products);
```

This component can then be used like so:

```jsx
<Products categoryID={1} />
```

## Server Side Rendering Usage

Below we will detail how to use this library for a _server side rendering_ application.

We have created an "ssr" import point so that the server side rendering related modules of this library will only be bundled into your source when used.

__Shared Code__

Let's say you had the following React application component you want to render on the server/client:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { job } from 'react-jobs/ssr'; // ‚ùóÔ∏è note the "/ssr"

// We attach a "job" to our app component.
function MyApp({ job }) {
  if (job.result) {
    return <div>{job.result}</div>;
  }
  return null;
}

// Use the job the same as you would in a "browser-only" implementation.
export default job(
  function work(props) {
    return fetch('/stuff').then(r => r.json())
  }
)(MyApp);
```

__Server__

```js
import { runJobs } from 'react-jobs/ssr'; // üëà
import React from 'react';
import { renderToString } from 'react-dom/server';
import serialize from 'serialize-javascript';
import MyApp from './shared/components/MyApp';

export default function expressMiddleware(req, res, next) {
  // üëá run the jobs on your app.
  runJobs(<MyApp />)
    //        üëá and you get back a result object.
    .then((runResult) => {
      const {
        // ‚ùóÔ∏è The runResult includes a decorated version of your app
        // that will have all the jobs data on it. Make sure you us
        // this for the renderToString call.
        app,
        // This state object represents the job state for the
        // render. You need to attach this to the response
        // so that the client app can rehydrate itself with
        // this data.
        state,
        // This is the identifier you should use when attaching
        // the state to the "window" object.
        STATE_IDENTIFIER
      } = runResult;

      const appString = renderToString(app);
      const html = `
        <html>
          <head>
            <title>Example</title>
          </head>
          <body>
            <div id="app">${appString}</div>
            <script type="text/javascript">
              window.${STATE_IDENTIFIER} = ${serialize(state)}
            </script>
          </body>
        </html>`;
      res.send(html);
    });
}
```

__Client__

```js
import React from 'react';
import { render } from 'react-dom';
import { rehydrateJobs } from 'react-jobs/ssr'; // üëà
import MyApp from './shared/components/MyApp';

//    Provide your app component to the rehydrateJobs function
//    so that the job data from the server is restored into your
//    the browser render of your app. This will make sure the
//    React checksums match with the response from the server
// üëá and will prevent any "double" rendering of your app.
rehydrateJobs(<MyApp />)
  //       üëá and you get back a result object.
  .then((rehydrateResult) => {
    const {
      // ‚ùóÔ∏è The rehydrateResult includes a decorated version of
      // your app that will have all the jobs data on it. Make
      // sure you us this for the render call.
      app,
    } = runResult;

    render(app, document.getElementById('app'));
  });
```
