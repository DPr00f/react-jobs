## ___WIP___

This library is in a complete state of flux at the moment.  I haven't done any releases, not even an alpha.  I am evolving the API through a test process.  This message will disappear after it settles enough for an alpha release.  Until then I wouldn't pay too much attention to this library. :)

## Introduction

This library provides you with a generic mechanism of attaching "jobs" to your React Components, and includes support for server rendering (i.e. within SSR/universal/isomorphic apps).

You can use these "jobs" to do any of the following:
 - Resolve additional data for your components in a sync/async manner.
 - ?

It provides you with a simple `function` and `Promise` based API which allows you to easily compose additional features such as data caching or 3rd party integrations (e.g. Redux).

## Installation

__npm__

```bash
npm i react-jobs -S
```

__yarn__

```bash
yarn add react-jobs
```

## Usage

Below we will detail how to use this library for the typical _browser_-only use.

In the naive example below we will use the `fetch` API (you'll need to [polyfill it](https://github.com/github/fetch) for older browsers) to retrieve data from an API endpoint.

```js
import React from 'react';
import { job } from 'react-jobs';
import Product from './components/Product';

function Products({ job, categoryID }) {
  // We provide a "job" prop containing the status/results of
  // the work you attached to your component.

  if (job.inProgress) {
    // If the work is still being processed (i.e. the Promise
    // is not yet resolved) then the `job.inProgress` boolean flag
    // value will be set to `true`.
    return <div>Retrieving...</div>;
  }

  if (job.error) {
    // If an error occurred whilst trying to execute your work
    // then the `job.error` will contain the error.
    return <div>Oh noes!</div>;
  }

  // Yay! We have the results!
  return (
    <div>
      {
        job.results.map(product =>
          <Product key={product.id} item={product} />
        )}
    </div>
  );
}

export default job(
  // Provide a function defining the work that needs to be done.
  // This function will be provided the props passed to your
  // component and must return a Promise for any asynchronous work.
  function work(props) {
    // Fetch the products for the given `categoryID` prop,
    return fetch(`/products/category/${props.categoryID}`)
      // then convert the response to JSON.
      .then(response => response.json());
  }
)(Products);
```

This component can then be used like so:

```jsx
<Products categoryID={1} />
```
